"Hyde Street Studios is San Francisco's longest running multi-studio recording facility, founded in 1980 by a partnership of Dan Alexander, Tom Sharples, and current owner Michael Ward.

There is a great history of musicians that have recorded in the studios, from their days as Wally Heider Recording (1969-1980) to present day, including the Grateful Dead, Herbie Hancock, Jefferson Airplane, Santana, John Lee Hooker, Tupac, Dead Kennedys, Green Day, Train, Cake, and too many others to name. 

These days, aside from an occasional major recording artist, most of the clientele are struggling local musicians. It is a mix of artists that represent the vibrant and resilient San Francisco music scene. Hyde Street Studios is one of very few remaining recording and music production facilities that artists can go to work on their music in San Francisco. 

Coming into 2020, the studio was booked out for months solid and going strong. After the shelter in place order, all studio sessions were cancelled. Being in an industry that works on very small margins already, with the loss of these bookings, after 40 years of operation, we now find ourselves in a dire situation. This campaign will allow us to pay the bills to weather this crisis.

The studio has fostered a wonderful community of musicians, engineers and producers and we want to make sure it is still there for everyone on the other side of this pandemic.

We're also looking into every means of financial support for the business. Unfortunately, we've found that we're ineligible for some primary federal and city assistance grants and forgivable loans that many other small businesses are getting. In the recording industry, the engineers that work in recording studios are freelance workers, and having a traditional payroll staff is a requirement for these programs. There are other grants we've applied for, which of course we are not guaranteed to get, and certainly wouldn't meet our short-term needs. Because of this, we must ask for your support.

This is a strange and trying time for everyone, and we understand there are many people and institutions in need. We feel that Hyde Street Studios is a valuable asset in the San Francisco cultural landscape. If you’re in a position to support us we’ll be extremely thankful for your generosity. The donations to this campaign will address our immediate bills and allow us to continue after this pandemic, hopefully for another 40 years and beyond. If you could let others know about this campaign, we’ll greatly appreciate that too.

A Statement from Mark Kozelek (Sun Kil Moon, Red House Painters)

Recording at Hyde Street Studios was a dream of mine that I was unable to afford until 1994, when my band at the time, Red House Painters, went to work on our fourth album, Ocean Beach.

An easy walk down the hill from where I live in San Francisco, Hyde Street Studios became the place where some portion of almost every studio album I made, since that time, was recorded. 

From Ocean Beach (1994) to Mark Kozelek with Ben Boye and Jim White 2 (2020), I've shared various sessions there
with musicians including Alan Sparhawk, Stephanie Finch, Steve Shelley, Donny McCaslin and Mike Patton. The recording engineers I've worked with there are A-list;  Mark Needham (Chris Isaac), Billy Anderson (Mr. Bungle, Sleep, Neurosis) and Nathan Winter, who has been on board with me from Mark Kozelek and Jimmy Lavalle - Perils From The Sea moving forward (Nathan also worked alongside Eddie Kramer at Hyde Street Studios, assisting on mixing Jimi Hendrix's Winterland).

All one needs to do is walk down it's halls to see the building's history. Framed albums include Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's De Ja Vu, Tupac Shakur's Tupacalypse Now, and most albums by The Dead Kennedys. I've recorded many of my vocals in the same spot where Grace Slick sang 'White Rabbit."" 

Throughout the years it was not uncommon to see various legends who made Hyde Street Studios their home, like Michael Franti, George Clinton and our beloved friend Butch (RIP) who looked out for us. I even showed Linda Ronstadt around the kitchen area while I was working on Sun Kil Moon's April in studio A and she was working upstairs in Studio D.

With the ever-changing climate of the music industry  - including a serious decline of physical album sales - I saw Hyde Street Studios survive obstacles that other local studios did not.  Now they've come upon their toughest battle with the coronavirus. With musicians out of live income and the economy being what it is, record labels are now wary to fund projects that cannot be promoted by tours.

Many people have asked what's kept me in San Francisco - a city that I've fallen a little out of touch with - with the boom of technology. I always say the same thing: ""Swan Oyster Depot, my apartment, and Hyde Street Studios.""

I recorded there very recently and I'm going to do what I can to help keep the place going. I mean, what is San Francisco, without Hyde Street Studios? A place to hang my hat and get good Oysters? Fuck that. Please help us to help Hyde Street Studios. 

If you can afford it, please buy an album that was recorded at Hyde Street Studios, or fill the room the next time Chuck Prophet, Michael Franti, or Sun Kil Moon gets the green light to play live concerts. And we'll all be back there, making music, like we always did.",Real
"“Help keep the love alive for the underground…. Juice Magazine is an independent voice for the underground and we need your help keeping it alive. You are part of our family and we want to keep the family connection going and keep making more magazines for you into the future. Juice has been independently publishing and keeping it punk for 26 years. Please help keep Juice alive – keep the voice of the people alive and independence alive.” – Jim Murphy, Juice Magazine Skate Editor

This is Shannon Smith, aka sk8mom, from Charleston, SC, with a call to kick down:
 
Juice Magazine has always stayed true to our culture – constantly giving back and supporting our scene and skate family. They have been instrumental in communicating our culture in an honest way and have never been compromised or sold out. To our great advantage, they have always found a way to get the information, inspiration and stoke to us come hell or high water. 

Now they could use a little back up, so please donate…

Our friend, Terri Craft, started Juice Magazine with $500 and a dream, and it has become an ongoing experiment of how the independent spirit can thrive and survive. Juice's commitment to our community has let us all enjoy the results of their passion, along with the help of the talented and dedicated contributors, advertisers, subscribers, editors, writers, photographers, designers, skate shops, surf shops, music stores, friends and family, which are the backbone of Juice. 

As they were on the way to printing their upcoming edition of Juice Magazine, they were hit by the effects of the suspension of business due to the coronavirus pandemic, now they are in a FINANCIAL CRISIS and need your assistance. The economic limitations imposed by this unexpected pandemic could crush their dreams and our core source of connecting with our surf/skate/music family.

Please check out the following accolades, write ups, and straight facts of their ongoing work and how much has been achieved in our scene over these past 26 years. All of these successes and achievements have happened because of their work to honor us all. 

You know what you gotta do - so thanks in advance and keep rollin.

""When I started Juice Magazine 26 years ago, you could count the number of skateparks on one hand and now there are thousands of skateparks all over the world. Two and a half decades ago, skateboarding related charities were non-existent. Today, there are numerous non-profits giving back to skateboarding in many vital ways. One of the most important differences between now and then is that, 26 years ago, there was a clear division between old school and new school skateboarding. Now that wall of separation has followed the same path as the Berlin Wall, allowing for an unprecedented unification of skateboarders all over the globe. Great strides have been made for girls that skate as well as the acceptance of skate history and long overdue recognition for skateboarding’s pioneers and its artifacts. At the same time, the current generation of skateboarders is taking skateboarding to new heights, previously unimaginable. Skateboarding is as diverse as the skateboarders that are addicted to it and the state of skate is strong. It has been the greatest honor to be part of the skate, surf, art and music family over the last quarter of a century and I just want to thank you all for the opportunity and for all of your support. I know these times are rough for everyone, so please know how much I believe in you. I hope you are staying safe and well out there and thank you for caring, sharing and contributing! Peace, love and respect always...

"The Boston-Cambridge Area Coronavirus Musicians Relief Fund is an emergency assistance fund that provides a resource to help local full time musicians who receive their sole income from performing music. Money will be distributed to those in need at the first of each month. The amount will be determined by how much is raised during that month. We are currently helping 20 full time musicians and their families.

The fund will remain open until this pandemic is over.

Those of us close to the music community know how the financial pressures of those local musicians who through their hard work, dedication and talents, bring so much joy and excitement to our lives.

The widespread cancellation of bars and restaurants has had a disproportionate impact on our music community - especially those who perform full time to pay their bills. Creatives are people whose very existence relies on what they create and people being able to access their work.

So if you love Boston music, and you have the resources to, please consider pitching in to The Boston Area Corona Virus Musicians Relief Fund. We will ensure the money goes directly to musicians in the Boston and Cambridge area who have had their gigs canceled.

We can get through this together.",Real
"Our friend Clovis Crane suffered a horrific barn fire on March 7th, leaving 15 animals perished in their stalls.

"If it wasn't for the support, whether financial, mental, emotional, or even with a simple retweet of my work, I have always felt supported by the community of queer writers of color. Many of us, queer writers of color, and supporters of our community, know how important it is to have support, especially financial. 

Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, many countries and cities have cancelled major events, and in light of this, many people, presses, journals, etc. have cancelled book tours and readings, which directly support writers; honestly, it puts money directly in their pockets, money that is needed for bills, medicine, food, transportation, creation, and more! Likewise, universities across USA have switched to online only and have closed their campuses, forcing students to go home, but a lot of students, especially black and brown students, especially queer black and brown students don't have this opportunity, and are in desperate need of funds. The closures of universities also effect teachers who rely on these classes to get paid. 

This impact has major affects on the literature community as a whole and puts queer writers of color in stressful situations, causing more widespread panic, and while I tip my hat to presses and publishers who have created bundled packages and discounted many of their books, those who aren't affiliated with them are still in need. Even those affiliated with said presses and publishers are in need. 

I was very inspired by the efforts of Ijeoma Oluo, who helped create the Seattle Artist Relief Fund . I want to help, too. I need to help.

This fund is to help at least 100 queer writers of color who have been financially impacted by the current COVID-19. Priority will be given to queer trans women of color and queer disabled writers of color, but I hope this relief fund will help many queer writers of color it can. 

If you are a queer writer of color in need of funds, please fill out this survey. 

Donors gifting $10 or more will receive a free .pdf copy of A HISTORY OF FLAMBOYANCE by Justin Phillip Reed and DREAM WITH A GLASS CHAMBER by Aricka Foreman, both from YesYes Books.

If you want to help with this fundraiser, please email us at [email redacted].

"It means so much the support and love we have received throughout our 14 years.
And it wouldn’t be possible with out community support.
The countless hours of art and music is hard to realize.
Musicians and artists have poured their heart and effort into bringing their visions to light.
Long before Roosevelt Row was the national giant it is today,
there was the Lost Leaf creating patiently in the shadows of its 1912 bungalow.
Through the years we’ve grown with you, and what it means to remain can’t be explained.
Just know that we love Phoenix!
We love Arizona and we are the arts.
We are the music in your head and the love in your soul.
Thank you so much!
To date, we are proud to have paid out from bar sales over $500,000 to musicians and artists.
We have never had a cover charge or taken an art commission from an art sale.
Due to the forced loss of business from the COVID19 out break, we will not be able to re-open without your support!
The Lost Leaf is a creative space where we foster music, art and the
love of life! Most all team members have been with us for over
10 years!
We have never had an investor, but now we need your help!",Real
"Bay Area Canine Club will be closing our doors in response to COVID19 to help protect our community. The closure, that will start on March 17th and will continue indefinitely, will be incredibly trying on our business. 
Our highest priority is our employees, a group of twelve remarkable, hard working individuals who provide love and care for all Bay Area Canine Club dogs, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We have strived to create a safe work place for our employees, highlighting those who are part of the LGBTQIA community. It is our goal to keep all our team members - Alex, James, Aidan, Casey, Anari, Monica, India, Bo, Nick, Marco, Tim, Fran, Natalie,  and Ari- on payroll with slightly reduced hours at San Francisco's minimum wage. With a loss of all incoming revenue, we need your help. 
We are asking for $75,000. The funds will go to our employees so that their well-being is not in jeopardy during this difficult time. The funds will guarantee that our team will not be let go and can securely return to their jobs as soon as possible. 
We want nothing more than to keep working. It is emotional to close our doors without knowing what will happen. We are doing our best to preserve Bay Area Canine Club and the team that makes it all possible. We love taking care of your dogs and are saddened that we will not be able to care for them daily. We are so grateful for any support you can provide.

"Chicago Police Officer Xu Meng End of Watch 09 June 2020, lost his life due to carbon monoxide poisoning after working 12+ straight days on a 12+ hour shift during the riots/looting/protest of Chicago. 

It was later determined that when no one picked up his 5 year old son from day care, 024th district was contacted. CPD and CFD went to his residence for a well-being check. When no one answered, CPD and CFD made forced entry into the home and found both Officer Meng and his wife unconscious in separate rooms. Both were transported to Swedish Covenant Hospital where Officer Meng succumbed to his injuries and his wife is still fighting for her life in critical condition, most likely due to carbon-monoxide poisoning. 

It was later determined that Officer Meng parked his vehicle in his garage which is connected to his home, and inadvertently left his car on due to the push-to-start feature and after being forced to work long hours with canceled days off during the riots/looting/protest throughout the city.

Officer Meng served the City of Chicago as a Police Officer for 2 year's.
He leaves behind a wife and 5 year old son. His wife is still in critical condition and there’s only one family member in the US. He was an active Asian American Law Enforcement Association Member (AALEA) Chicago Chapter & FOP Lodge 7 member who participated in many of our functions.

Officers throughout the country lose their lives almost everyday serving and protecting the very city and country they knew and once loved, even during dyer times. Officer Meng unfortunately lost his life due to extreme fatigue and exhaustion from serving and protecting our community from criminals, looters, and rioters. All donations will directly help Officer Meng's 5 year old son and wife. His family needs you!

"I haven't placed an update in a few weeks:/ I am currently on my second round of treatments which has consisted of 4 weeks of chemo (1 more to go) and 3 rounds of radiation ( 1 more to go). I ran into some complications with doing radiation and chemo the same day my heart rate was dropping. They split them up and things have been a little easier when it comes to treatments. I've still been beyond sick and have been fighting migraines. I also had a bad scare with cutting open my hand on valentine's day and ended up in the er. I have been trying to stay afloat and positive in my battle! I have received some terrible expensive doctor bills which have me in a panic. They are only 2 of the beginning mess.
