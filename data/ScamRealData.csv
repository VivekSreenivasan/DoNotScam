"Hi! My name is Marlie Jean Curwin. My Mama’s name is Erin. On January 5th, Mama noticed that I wasn’t using one of my legs very well. It was sore and swollen and I had a little fever too; I just wasn’t feeling myself. She took me to the doctor and we stayed a couple of days in the Moncton Hospital. They did some tests on me and before I knew it, on January 7th, they flew me to the IWK. That was my first plane ride and I didn’t like it one bit.
The next day, I was visited by lots of people. Some came to talk and see my leg and some came to take my blood....I didn’t give it up without a fight though. Then a doctor came to just talk. They said I have AML Leukemia. I’m not sure what that means, but I know my Mama and Aunty Kellie started to cry. Mama and I are told this place will be our home for the next 4-6 months. I heard Mama say that we would be out of here in 4 months because apparently I’m very strong willed and stubborn and she knows I can do it. I’d like to add that I’m also smart, funny and…very cute!
I will be turning 1 years old on February 9th. It’s not the best place to celebrate your birthday but I still get to have a little party. They are really great to us here at the IWK. My family all loves me SO much, especially Mama; she hasn’t left my side. I have the best Mama! My Aunty has been here with Mama and me most of the time too. My Grammy (Veva) and Grampy (Gary) will be visiting me lots and lots. I know my family is scared and I realize that I need them with me right now, but I worry that they will become financially and emotionally drained.
Please help them to have one less thing to worry about… they are worried enough.
Love,
Marlie",Real

Any little bit will help.
There will also be 2 trusts set up in his name, one essentially giving him the ability to collect a small ‘salary’ each year and another retirement trust which will be wisely invested by a financial planner which he will have access to in a time frame he feels comfortable with so when the time comes he can live his retirement dream of owning a piece of land and a cabin in the country. A bank account will be set up for him with funds for everyday needs that will get him through until he finds a job. And lastly, he will be donating to a few organizations and people who over the last couple of years have helped him get through this rough patch in his life.",Fake

"WHILE A POST LIKE THIS ALREADY EXIST I WANTED TO TAKE THE TIME TO POST IN DETAIL ABOUT MY BROTHER COREY, WHO SINCE THE AGE OF 14 HAS BEEN AN AVID ‘DU’ JUNKIE, ALWAYS REFERRING TO YOU AS HIS “DU FAMILY”
Corey Baker is a deeply loved brother, uncle, friend and respected member of the community. Anyone who knows him understands his passion for giving back to those in need. Corey is a proud Democrat and a dedicated member of the website DemocraticUnderground.com since the age of 14. In addition to his support of the Democratic Party, he has a dedicated career as a Security Officer. Corey is also attending college pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice. Mr Baker also spends his free time volunteering for the Habitat 4 Humanity, volunteering at homeless shelters and volunteering at our local VA Medical Center by providing prayers and counseling to our nations Veterans. He is very active in politics beginning at the age of 10 years old when he witnessed the theft of the 2000 Election. From that point on Corey became hooked on politics and donated his allowances to the Democratic Party & Democratic candidates. Corey grew up fast on 9/11 as a 7th grade student. I remember specifically him telling me that fateful day that “elections have consequences, and this, he said is a consequence of the 2000 election”
From that day on he was extremely active in politics. He was the youngest member in the history of our county Democratic party. He was strongly opposed to the Iraq war at a time especially in our school when it was extremely unpopular to be against the war, not to mention being a openly proud Liberal Democrat. As the 2004 election approached & during the Democratic primary, Corey absolutely fell in love with John Kerry. I’ve never saw my brother more passionate about anyone or any cause than electing John Kerry President! I remember fondly the day my father took him to a John Kerry campaign rally, he still has the newspaper article hanging above his bed, October 19, 2004 Dayton Daily News paper. He talks about it frequently he was only feet from his hero John Kerry & John Glenn was there. John Kerry is his hero & his idol to this day, just as my brother is my hero because he is a fighter, just like John Kerry…?
On Saturday, February 18, 2017 around 11:45 pm Corey was on his home from his Security job in Dayton, Ohio, when he was involved in a serious car accident.
Initial reports indicate that Corey was at a stop light with a green arrow and proceeded to turn left when he was t-boned by a reckless driver who failed to stop for the red light.
Corey is currently in critical but stable condition after being taken by Careflight helicopter to a level 1 trauma center. His injuries include: a fractured skull, fractured hip, bleeding in the brain (update: the bleeding in the brain has stopped), loss of mobility in his left arm (update: mobility is there, but limited), among other serious issues.
As you can imagine this accident has and will continue to have a serious detrimental impact on the finances of the entire Baker family. His parents are going to be missing work to be with him even though they have no savings and so many utility bills coming up for disconnect this week as well as rent coming up to be paid Saturday & it’s unclear when or if Corey will be able to ever return ttowork which his income helped pay for his College.
So my friends, perfect strangers, whomever you may be I have turned to this site as a last resort. Due to this unforeseen accident my family is on the brink of losing everything!!! So from the bottom of my heart I ask that you contribute any amount you can afford to help us in this time of great need…
THANK YOU & GOD BLESS
************SAD UPDATE***************
UNFORTUNATELY COREY’S CONDITION HAS WORSENED… ? ? ?
It is with a heavy heart that I announce to you that my brother Corey’s condition has taken a turn for the worse.
He was transported to University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio which has in itself caused extreme financial peril for our family. Corey was being treated at a hospital in Dayton, Ohio which was only 45 minutes from his family home.
Now that he is being treated at University Hospital in Columbus financially we are devastated. Columbus is about 3 hours from our home and we cannot afford to stay in a hotel nor can we afford the 6 hour commute (there & back).
My family especially my parents are devastated to say the least. They live paycheck to paycheck and want to be by his side 24/7 but financial limitations are about to prevent that.
Please if you haven’t contributed yet every dollar counts. My parents & my family are scared to death that if the worst were to happen to Corey we would not be able to be there to say goodbye do to financial restrictions…
The Baker family would like to thank all that have contributed & sent good vibes to our family during this the time of such heartache in our family.
Please spread the word to those who are financially able to contribute, your help is needed now more than ever.

OUR FAMILY IS IN FINANCIAL PERIL AND UNFORTUNATELY CANNOT AFFORD THE 6 HOUR COMMUTE (there & back) NOR CAN WE AFFORD TO GET A HOTEL ROOM & COREY NEEDS US BY HIS SIDE NOW MORE THAN EVER!

We have a list of places around the country and around the world that we would love to visit together!  Thank you again!!!
Hello, 
My name is Brady Hunker and I would like to share a little bit about my story of finding love while battling cancer. 
In 2016, at the age of fifteen, I was diagnosed with Ewing Sarcoma, a form of bone cancer.  At my initial diagnosis, the tumor in my right leg was so large that I feared I would lose my leg.  At this time, my then girlfriend, Mollie Landman, always encouraged me and gave me hope in my darkest days. 
After months of long stays at the hospital due to chemotherapy treatments, leg salvage surgery, and radiation, I was ""cancer free"" and went into remission. 
About a year went by, and the cancer unfortunately returned with a vengeance.  I now have numerous cancer spots in my spinal column, right arm, both shoulder blades, both upper legs, right calf, both lungs, pelvis, ribs, and possibly more that were not visible on the scans.   I have been continuing treatment for 13 months now, but none of these chemotherapies have worked as well as my treatments did in 2016.
Although my prognosis isn't encouraging, my perspective on life and my priorities have drastically changed. I live every day not knowing when my last will come, and I try to make the most of the time I have left. That being said, I live my life doing what makes me happy, and surround myself with people who love and care for me more than I could ever imagine. These people are my mom and dad, sister, close friends, and the love of my life, Mollie.
We met in 2014 in school, and instantly became very close. We attended school dances together, hung out in and out of school, and continued to grow closer. When I was diagnosed two years later, Mollie became my sidekick, always by my side, ready to fight this battle with me. She would get me things in the hospital, spend time with me while I was getting chemo, bring me bags to throw up in,  practically do anything I needed.  Mollie selflessly helped me on my most difficult days, and was always there to make me smile. 
I honestly cannot imagine going through this battle without her, and I couldn't be more thankful for such an incredible girl coming into my life and staying to help me through the toughest battle I could imagine.
One night, Mollie and I were having a deep conversation, which is common for us, about regrets in life. We posed the question, ""If we heard the worst news, if I was given a week to live, and then I would pass away,  what would I regret not doing?"" The only thing that we could come up with is getting married. In a world full of possibilities and opportunity, if I lost my fight, I would only regret not marrying Mollie. We don't know when that day will come, or if it ever will, but what we do know is that we don't have a reason to wait. 
I proposed to Mollie over Easter weekend, and she said YES!!  
Due to my diagnosis, we want to get married soon, as we don't know what the future holds, and want to spend as long married as we can. Therefore, we plan to get married over the summer!
Now, here is where I need all of your help!  I have not been able to work or save up money because of my fight against cancer, but I want the love of my life to have the wedding she always dreamed of.  
I am asking you to donate to our wedding to help make the day a dream come true for both Mollie and I. Any donations will go towards food, venue, clothes, transportation, cake, our honeymoon, and anything else that comes up. 
Thank you so much for reading through our story and helping in any way that you can!
Also, here is a YouTube video of my love story with Mollie. ",Real
"Since her diagnosis she has only spent a short amount of time at home as she’s constantly in and out of the hospital, first of all with neutropenic sepsis, then a central line infection, and now shingles and influenza B! She hasn’t been able to continue her chemo for over 3 weeks. So we’ve decided to try and raise some money to take kimberley to disney land as something for her to look forward to!

Kimberley hasn’t been able to attend much school and has unfortunately missed out on trips they have organised.

"This is my sweet daughter, Alexandra, born on 19.09.2019. But everything was too beautiful to be true. Within a month of giving birth, my maternal instincts made me more aware that something wasn’t right- Alexandra was moving her legs less and less. We run to the emergency neurologist specialist who gave us the diagnosis - ""suspicion of spinal amyotrophy type I"". Our world turned upside down, our world was spinning, as I started reading more about Alexandra’s diagnosis. Alexandra is suffering from an incurable genetic disease, which affects motor neurons by immobilizing children and most of the children have respiratory arrest by age 18 months and die. I never felt so much pain, but the dark days just started for our family. I found out that in Romania there is a project that helps children by injecting with Spinraza (every 4 months all their life), this is the medicine that can help children affected by this disease.
But soon after, with severe pneumonia, we were admitted into the pediatric resuscitation department where for two weeks, Alexa and the doctors, struggled not to connected our baby to any device.
Thanks God she is better now, but she lost all her powers, including eating alone, she is now fed through the nasogastric tube. On December 24, 2019, Alexandra received the first dose. I can’t describe my emotions: 5 ml of fluid was removed from her spine and 5 ml of Spinraza were injected, without my baby being sedated ... it was very difficult for me to assist during this procedure, but the thought that it will help her encouraged both of us . I know, we are just at the beginning of the path, but I believe in my child and in the kindness and prayers of people around us. I know that she can be SAVED!
Our ultimate goal is to benefit from ZOLGENSMA, the $ 2,100,000 vaccine that can stop the disease from developing, but this vaccine can only be given up to the age of 2 years, that is why time is running against us.
At the same time, we also need 2 devices: BiPaP and coughassist which would allow Alexnadra to breathe easier. I do understand this is a huge amount of money, but this is the ONLY CHANCE our baby girl has and we, as parents will do whatever it takes to make this possible. We are asking for your help, so our baby can play, and laugh, and dance as any other child. She is our little treasure, extremely loved. We only can do this with your involvement and generosity.
I brought Alexandra into this world, but you can give her LIFE!

When you find out you're going to be a mom, everything changes. From that moment on, your life will be completely different, and you start worrying about being able to ensure a good life, a good academic education, the best environment and a more comfortable and safe route throughout your life. And you do it with an unconditional love and you are excited to think about the precious and unique moments to enjoy with your baby.
You give birth to your baby and the doctor leaves it in your shaking hands. It is the best feeling in the world. The first contact between you makes you a natural teacher to handle everything that scared you before for lack of experience. You start feeling more secure. And the more you share something with your baby, the more you enjoy being a mother. You already have the answer instinctively of all the questions that you had when you were pregnant. And now is the time to grow together with your baby, cry together, laugh together ...
But at one point, even if you have no idea what is happening, something happens and time starts to run in the wrong direction. And that moment all your future plans are shattered, motherhood already has another dimension and your sweet dreams are replaced by a tremendous concern. Because your daughter is diagnosed with a rare disease: Spinal Muscular Atrophy
At first you don't want to believe it. Your heart is broken You blame yourself because you have brought it into the world. Your baby is innocent. On the one hand, you die of regret, your soul hurts, you have the words drowned in your throat but on the other hand the doctors keep telling you that your daughter has to start her treatment immediately. Because every moment, a motor neuron dies.
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, which is manifested by a progressive loss of muscle strength that affects the ability to walk, swallow and breathe. And it is the first genetic cause of infant mortality. It is caused by a mutation in the survival gene of motor neurons 1 (SMN1). This gene is responsible for the production of a protein that is critical for the nerves that control our muscles. Without this protein, these neurons cannot function properly and die at any given time.
Our daughter Nil is 18 months old. And there is a genetic therapy called ""Zolgensma"" approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children under 2 years old with a price of 2.15 million dollars. Zolgensma is designed to replace the missing or defective SMN1 gene with a functional copy that produces the SMN protein, thereby improving the function and survival of motor neurons. It seems that Zolgensma can save lives of those who are lucky enough to get it with a single dose treatment.
Today Nil can't stand or walk. Unfortunately, we don't have a second to lose. We imagine her walking, running, playing with her friends and we want her to be part of society, feel proud of herself and have a long life.",Real

What we saw on that tape left us shell shocked; a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling directly on my brother's neck, obstructing his ability to breathe. As some officers knelt on his neck, other officers participated and watched; no one took any action to save my brother's life.  Those officers would continue to brutalize my brother until he died. This fund is established to cover funeral and burial expenses, mental and grief counseling, lodging and travel for all court proceedings, and to assist our family in the days to come as we continue to seek justice for George.  A portion of these funds will also go to the Estate of George Floyd for the benefit and care of his children and their educational fund.

"Native Innovation looks forward to changing lives by bringing high-speed internet to underserved rural communities of the Navajo Nation. NII is raising money for equipment to service 100 homes on the Navajo Nation.
The Navajo Nation (Navajo: Naabeehó Bináhásdzo) is an American Indian[2] territory covering about 17,544,500 acres (71,000 km2; 27,413 sq mi), occupying portions of northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and northwestern New Mexico in the United States. This is the largest land area retained by an indigenous tribe in the United States, with a population of roughly 350,000 as of 2016.
We Native Innovation will install and setup 100 homes with broadband for FREE. 
Millions of Americans lack access to reliable broadband, because delivering high-speed internet in sparsely populated areas is challenging, and costly. But without internet, communities miss out on opportunities to learn, connect, and access the global economy. We are on a mission to bring broadband to places other companies have been unable to go, by using rural network routers that deliver LTE Speeds. Each home will be fitted with two Yagi 900 MHZ antennas as well as a rural broadband router. 
Help us in raising money to connect these rural homes on the Navajo Nation with internet. Covid19 has hit the Navajo Nation hard and most students are without any internet services to participate in online classes to submit their work. 
This would be a small step in bridging the gap for our people of the Navajo Nation.",Real
